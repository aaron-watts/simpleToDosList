### A Simple To Do List

###To Do List Project For Web Dev Udemy Course.

Goal of the project was to learn Javascript.
I also decided I'd learn some more CSS and DOM, by
making it in the style of a Windows 95 desktop and
command prompt.

Icons were sourced from [Chicago 95](https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95/blob/master/Screenshots/SCREENSH) for Linux.

The entire page is made using only html, CSS and 
javascript. [See Here](https://agitated-villani-ec2285.netlify.app/)
